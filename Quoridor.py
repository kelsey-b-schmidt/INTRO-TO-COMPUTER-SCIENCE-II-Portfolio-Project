class QuoridorGame:
    """
    Creates a game of Quoridor, to be played by two players.
    The board is formed by a 9x9 grid, upon which the two players will each have a pawn,
    and each player's pawn will move on the cells. Each player will have 10 fences.
    The fences can be placed on the edges of the cells,
    to obstruct the other player's pawn's movement.

    The board spaces are numbered 0-8 from left to right, and 0-8 from top to bottom.
    The board positions start with (0,0) at the furthest top left,
    and end with (8,8) at the furthest bottom right.
    The four edges are labeled as fences, and the rows of the cells where the pawns
    are positioned at the start of the game (rows 0 and 8) are called base lines.

    A pawn's position (x,y) is defined by the coordinate of the top left corner
    of the cell that the pawn is on. 'x' is the number from the vertical line,
    and 'y' is the number from the horizontal line, that make the top left corner of the cell.
    At the beginning of the game, player 1 places their pawn (P1)
    on the top center of the board, (4,0), and player 2 places their pawn (P2)
    on the bottom center of the board, (4,8).

    Player 1 will start the game.
    On a playerâ€™s turn they will make one move, which which they can either:
        move the pawn (move_pawn)
        OR
        place a fence (place_fence).
    See valid move rules and valid fence placement rules below.
    Once a player makes a valid move or places a valid fence, their turn is over,
    and it moves to the next player's turn.
    The first player whose pawn reaches any of the cells
    of the opposite player's base line wins the game.
    No turn can be played after a player has won.

    To move a pawn, you call move_pawn, with parameters of the player making the move (1 or 2)
    and the intended space (x,y) that you want the pawn to be moved to.
    (ex. move_pawn(2, (4,7))
    A valid move for a player to make would be moving one space horizontally or vertically,
    unless blocked by a fence, with no diagonal movement allowed EXCEPT for a special condition.
    If facing the other player's piece directly, you are allowed to jump over the other piece,
    assuming no fence is behind the other player's piece that would stop that movement.

    It is in this case ONLY, when a pawn could otherwise jump over an opponent's piece,
    but is blocked by a fence directly behind that piece,
    that the player can move one space *diagonally*
    to either of the spaces to the side of the opponent's piece, in lieu of jumping over.
    In this same scenario, if there is a fence to the *side* of the opponent's piece,
    in the intended diagonal move direction, that move is blocked by the fence, and cannot be completed.

    Since the edge of the board is considered a fence, diagonal movement is also allowed
    when facing a pawn that abuts the edge of the board, given no fence to the side of the
    enemy pawn prevents such a move.

    When a player tries to place a fence on the board, the position of the fence is defined
    by a letter and coordinates; 'v' for vertical fences, 'h' for horizontal fences,
    and a tuple of the coordinates. So, for example, 'h',(6,5) would be a horizontal fence
    starting at the (6,5) coordinate, and drawn one space to the right, whereas  'v',(6,5)
    would be a vertical fence starting at the (6,5) coordinate, and drawn one space down.
    Fences only block one square, and cannot be moved once placed, nor can they be re-used.
    Fences cannot be arranged in such a way that makes it impossible for the other player to win,
    such as blocking a player in, or blocking the target side of the board entirely.
    (This is the fair play rule).
    This class may raise a FairPlayBroken exception, which is handled.
